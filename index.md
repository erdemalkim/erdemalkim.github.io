My main interest is improving efficiency of algorithms with using assembly level optimizations. I am also interested in cryptography, computer architecture, parallel programming, heterogeneous computing and hardware accelerators. 

I worked as an [ERCIM fellow](https://fellowship.ercim.eu/) at [Frauhofer Institute for Secure Information
Technology](https://www.sit.fraunhofer.de/en/), Darmstadt, Germany.

I am an assistant professor at [Department of Computer Science][dep], Dokuz Eylul
University. I had my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Mathematics][dep2] of Ege University in İzmir, Turkey.
My dissemination topic was "Analysis, Design and Efficient implementation of
Next Generation Cryptosystems", and my advisors were [Urfat Nuriyev](http://fen.ege.edu.tr/~urfat/eng_kisisel_bilgiler.html) and [Peter Schwabe](https://www.cryptojedi.org). I am also working with [Sedat Akleylek](https://sites.google.com/a/bil.omu.edu.tr/akleylek/home) in several projects.

I am contributing three NIST submissions, for [Post-Quantum standardization
process](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions).
One can find details in [NewHope](https://newhopecrypto.org/),
[qTesla](https://tesla.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/tesla/), and
[FrodoKEM](https://frodokem.org/).

I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK,  between 17 July
2017 and 6 October 2017. My internship project was contributing
[FrodoKEM](https://frodokem.org/) submission to NIST Post-Quantum standardization process.

I was a visiting student in [Digital Security Group](http://www.ru.nl/ds), Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.
In here, I had been working on efficient implementations of lattice-based
cryptographic primitives with [Peter Schwabe](https://www.cryptojedi.org), between April 2015 and April 2016 and between October 2016 and April 2017.


I had my MSc. degree from [Department of Computer Engineering][depy] 
of Ondokuz Mayıs University in Samsun, Turkey. During my master study, I have worked as a research assistant in the department and also participated in two Scientific Research Projects.
During My master, I studied on the FPGA implementations of some algorithms that have applications in cryptography, coding theory, signal processing and machine learning.  


I have [published](/pubs.html) papers on topics in artificial neural networks,
hardware implementation, parallel processing and also lattice-based
cryptography.
